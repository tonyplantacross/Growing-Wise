            <p> For safety and best practice the activities are done in small groups.
            The class is split in half. One half stays in school, whilst the other half completes the activity. With a Teacher or TA present and required, Tony from Growing wise will lead the activity.
            All activities can be done outdoors but if the weather is too bad there are alternatives for the classroom and the whole class to enjoy.
            <strong> All activities are risk assessed and are updated with covid -19 guidelines. Full clean DBS. </strong> </p>

          Tony is well resourced and has all of the equipement with him needed for each session which has obviously been well thought through, even down to having pencils attached to clipboards for the 
          younger children, Everything is organised in this way enabled the lessons to run smoothly. Children were asked to create a bug hotel in one session and loved using different materials to make their own which was then put together
          and put into the word. In the rain gauge lesson bottles were prepared for the children and they enjoyed putting together the gauge and measuring the water each week. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Lessons showed progress and objectives taught were clear and given to the children in a child friendly way. Children knew what they were learning in each session and the previous session was always recapped.
          </p>
          <p>
          Lessons were exciting, engaging and fun children loved the 'Bee Game' and were unaware they were learning whilst having a great time.

          During the visit, Tony was a real pleasure to work with, as he showed real enthusiasm when delivering the subject material, which was engaging for the pupils. Tony's subject knowlegde is very in-depth and 
          he is becoming more skilled at delivering this at a level to develop the pupils' understanding. He, also asked the class though provoking questions, which helped to stimulate different discussion. Before the visit,
          Tony was very keen to liaise with myself on overall aims and objectives of the visit, which he linked to the nationcal curriculum, From this, he planned an in-depth visit for the pupils, which was both educational and fun,
          with appropriatea age-related activities. After the visit, the pupils were able to use their experiences, to put their learning into real-life contexts back in the classroom. The visit was a very enjoyable experience for the pupils
          which was well planned and led by Tony Cross.
