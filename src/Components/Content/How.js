                Free Taster: One afternoon visit for one year group, per school.
                Please note that for the children to gain maximum benefit, the actual course is designed for children to have repeated sessions to build on their learning.

                One day per week for half or full term (6 or 12 weeks). 
                For safety and a better pupil to adult ratio, I work with a Teacher or TA; half a class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.
                Choose from either working with one year group or all six.
                Available for Spring, Summer and Autumn terms.
                I will visit your school, speak to you about what you want to achieve and take note of what space and resources you have.
                Using the information gathered from the initial visit I will devise a programme to suit your needs (and budget). Itâ€™s that easy.
